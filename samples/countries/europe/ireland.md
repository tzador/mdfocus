## History

Ireland has ancient Celtic heritage. English/British rule lasted centuries, marked by the Great Famine (1845-1852). Most of Ireland gained independence in 1922, with Northern Ireland remaining in the UK.

The "Celtic Tiger" economic boom (1990s-2008) transformed Ireland. The 2008 crisis required a bailout, but recovery has been strong.

## Geography

Ireland is mostly low-lying with Atlantic coastline. The landscape includes bogs, lakes, and rolling hills. The climate is mild and wet due to Atlantic influence.

## Economy

Ireland has become wealthy through technology, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. Many multinationals have European headquarters in Ireland due to low corporate taxes. Agriculture remains important.

## Culture

Irish culture is known for literature (Joyce, Yeats), traditional music, and pub culture. St. Patrick's Day is celebrated globally. The Irish diaspora is influential, especially in the US.
