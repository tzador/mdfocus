## History

Ukraine has ancient history as the center of Kievan Rus'. It was divided between various powers before brief independence (1918). Soviet Ukraine existed until 1991. The 2014 Euromaidan revolution ousted a pro-Russian president, leading to Russia's annexation of Crimea and war in Donbas.

Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 began Europe's largest war since WWII.
