## History

Albania has ancient Illyrian heritage. Ottoman rule lasted from the 15th century until independence in 1912. After WWII, Enver Hoxha imposed one of the world's most isolated communist regimes until 1991.

The transition to democracy was turbulent, including a 1997 crisis triggered by pyramid schemes. Albania has since stabilized and pursues EU integration.
