Nicaragua was part of Spanish Central America until independence in 1821. US intervention marked the early 20th century. The Sandinista revolution (1979) overthrew the Somoza dictatorship. Civil war against US-backed Contras followed.

Daniel Ortega returned to power in 2007 and has consolidated authoritarian control, particularly since 2018 protests.

## Geography

## Economy

Nicaragua is one of the poorest Latin American countries. Agriculture, manufacturing, and remittances drive the economy. Tourism has been affected by political instability.
