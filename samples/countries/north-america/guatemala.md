Guatemala was the center of Maya civilization and later the seat of Spanish colonial power in Central America. Independence came in 1821. A 36-year civil war (1960-1996) killed over 200,000, with Maya communities particularly affected.

Guatemala has volcanic highlands, Pacific coast, Caribbean coast, and lowland jungles (Petén) where Maya cities like Tikal are found. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are significant risks.

Guatemala has Central America's largest economy, though wealth is very unequally distributed. Coffee, sugar, bananas, and textiles are key exports. Remittances are crucial.
