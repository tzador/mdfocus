## History

The Congo River basin was home to various Bantu kingdoms before King Leopold II of Belgium established the Congo Free State as his personal colony in 1885, notorious for brutal exploitation. It became the Belgian Congo in 1908 and gained independence in 1960 as the Republic of the Congo.

The country was ruled by Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-1997), who renamed it Zaire. His overthrow led to devastating wars (1996-2003) that killed millions. Conflict continues in eastern provinces, driven by ethnic tensions and competition for resources.

## Geography

The DRC is dominated by the Congo River basin and rainforest, containing the world's second-largest tropical forest. The eastern border features the Albertine Rift, home to Africa's Great Lakes and active volcanoes. The country has incredible biodiversity, including endangered mountain gorillas, bonobos, and okapis.

## Economy

Despite enormous mineral wealth—cobalt, copper, diamonds, gold, coltan—the DRC remains extremely poor due to conflict, corruption, and mismanagement. The country holds about 70% of the world's cobalt reserves, essential for electric vehicle batteries. Agriculture is the main livelihood for most Congolese.

## Culture

The DRC has over 200 ethnic groups and languages. Congolese rumba and soukous music have influenced musicians worldwide. The country is known for its vibrant art scene, including the Kinshasa school of painting and fashion culture of "sapeurs." Football is immensely popular.
