## History

The region has been inhabited for millennia, with various ethnic groups and kingdoms. British colonial rule administered the south separately from Arab-dominated north. Prolonged civil wars (1955-1972 and 1983-2005) between north and south Sudan killed millions.

A 2011 referendum resulted in overwhelming support for independence. However, civil war erupted in 2013 between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar, causing massive displacement and famine.

## Geography

South Sudan is largely tropical, with the world's largest swamp, the Sudd, covering much of the central region. The White Nile flows through the country. The terrain includes savanna, floodplains, and forests. Wildlife populations, including elephants, have been decimated by conflict.

## Economy

South Sudan is extremely poor despite substantial oil reserves. Oil provides nearly all government revenue but production has been disrupted by conflict. Most of the population depends on subsistence agriculture and pastoralism. The country lacks basic infrastructure and services.

## Culture

South Sudan has over 60 ethnic groups, including the Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk. Cattle have cultural and economic importance, particularly among pastoralist communities. Traditional music, dance, and scarification practices vary by ethnic group.
