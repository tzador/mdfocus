## History

South Africa has rich archaeological history, including early human ancestors at Cradle of Humankind. Dutch settlers arrived in 1652, followed by British colonization. The discovery of diamonds and gold transformed the economy.

The National Party implemented apartheid (1948-1994), a system of racial segregation. Nelson Mandela's release in 1990 and democratic elections in 1994 marked a peaceful transition. The ANC has governed since 1994.

## Geography

South Africa has diverse landscapes: the Drakensberg mountains, the Kalahari semi-desert, the Garden Route, and extensive coastlines on both Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Kruger National Park is one of Africa's largest game reserves. The country has a generally temperate climate.

## Economy

South Africa has Africa's second-largest economy, diversified across mining, manufacturing, finance, and services. It is a major producer of gold, platinum, and diamonds. Despite economic strength, inequality remains extreme. Load-shedding (power cuts) reflects infrastructure challenges.
