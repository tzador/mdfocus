## History

The region around Lake Chad has been inhabited for thousands of years and was home to powerful kingdoms, including the Kanem-Bornu Empire. France colonized the territory in the early 20th century. Chad gained independence on August 11, 1960.

The country has experienced persistent civil conflict, often involving tensions between the predominantly Muslim north and Christian/animist south. Idriss Déby ruled from 1990 until his death in 2021, when a military council took power.

## Geography

Chad spans multiple climatic zones: the Sahara Desert in the north, the semi-arid Sahel in the center, and a more fertile Sudanian savanna in the south. Lake Chad, once one of Africa's largest lakes, has shrunk dramatically due to climate change and irrigation. The Tibesti Mountains in the north contain the highest peak, Emi Koussi (3,445 m).

## Economy

Chad is one of the world's poorest countries despite significant oil reserves discovered in the south in 2003. Oil has become the dominant export, but wealth distribution remains extremely unequal. Most Chadians depend on subsistence agriculture and herding. Periodic droughts and conflict severely impact food security.

## Culture

Chad is home to over 200 ethnic groups, creating a rich cultural tapestry. Traditional music and dance vary significantly by region, from the Sara people in the south to the Toubou in the north. Handicrafts include leatherwork, pottery, and woven goods. The country observes both Muslim and Christian holidays.
