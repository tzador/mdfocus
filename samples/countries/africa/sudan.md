## History

Sudan has ancient history, including the Nubian kingdoms of Kush and Meroë, which rivaled ancient Egypt. Arab traders brought Islam beginning in the 7th century. Britain and Egypt jointly ruled from 1899 until independence on January 1, 1956.

Omar al-Bashir ruled from 1989 to 2019, when he was overthrown following popular protests. The Darfur conflict, beginning in 2003, resulted in mass atrocities. Ongoing conflict between the army and paramilitary forces erupted in 2023.

## Geography

Sudan is characterized by the Nile River system, with the Blue and White Niles meeting at Khartoum. The terrain includes the Nubian Desert in the north, semi-arid Sahel, and fertile lands along the Nile. The country has a hot, dry climate with seasonal rains in the south.

## Economy

Sudan lost most of its oil reserves when South Sudan seceded, severely impacting the economy. Agriculture employs most of the population, with gum arabic (used in food products) being a major export. Sanctions were lifted in 2020, but conflict has disrupted economic recovery.

## Culture

Sudanese culture blends Arab and African influences. Music and poetry are highly valued. Traditional wrestling is popular. The country has numerous archaeological sites, including the pyramids of Meroë. Sudanese cuisine features dishes like ful medames and kisra.
