## History

The region was inhabited by various ethnic groups before French colonization in the late 19th century, when it became Ubangi-Shari. Independence came on August 13, 1960. The country's post-independence history has been marked by coups, dictatorships, and civil conflicts.

The rule of Jean-Bédel Bokassa (1966-1979), who declared himself emperor, was particularly notorious. Multiple civil wars since 2004 have displaced hundreds of thousands and created a humanitarian crisis.

## Geography

CAR is a landlocked plateau country, with elevations mostly between 600-900 meters. The north is part of the Sahel, while the south has dense tropical rainforests. The Ubangi and Sangha rivers form parts of the southern border. The country has significant biodiversity, including forest elephants and lowland gorillas.

## Economy

CAR has rich natural resources, including diamonds, gold, uranium, and timber, but remains extremely poor due to decades of conflict and mismanagement. Most of the population engages in subsistence farming. The economy depends heavily on foreign aid, and infrastructure is minimal outside of Bangui.

## Culture

The population includes numerous ethnic groups, each with distinct traditions. Sango serves as a lingua franca alongside French. Traditional music features instruments like the balafon and ngombi. Despite hardships, the Central African people maintain rich traditions of oral literature, dance, and craftsmanship.
