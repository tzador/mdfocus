## History

The region was part of several West African empires, including Mali and Songhai. France colonized the territory in the 1890s. Guinea was the only French African colony to reject membership in the French Community, voting for immediate independence in 1958.

Sékou Touré led the country autocratically until 1984. Subsequent rulers have included Lansana Conté (1984-2008) and Alpha Condé (2010-2021), who was overthrown in a military coup.

## Geography

Guinea has four distinct geographical regions: the coastal plain, the Fouta Djallon highlands (source of the Niger, Senegal, and Gambia rivers), the Upper Niger Basin savanna, and the forested southeast highlands. Mount Nimba, shared with Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia, is the highest point.

## Economy

Guinea has enormous mineral wealth, including the world's largest bauxite reserves, significant iron ore deposits, and gold and diamonds. Despite this, it remains poor due to mismanagement, corruption, and infrastructure deficits. Agriculture employs most of the population.

## Culture

Guinea is known as a cultural center of West Africa, particularly for its music. Traditional instruments include the djembe drum and balafon. The country has produced renowned musicians like Mory Kanté and Sékouba Bambino. The Susu, Fula, and Mandinka are the largest ethnic groups.
