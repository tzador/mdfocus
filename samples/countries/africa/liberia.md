## History

The American Colonization Society founded Liberia in 1822 as a settlement for freed American slaves. The Republic of Liberia declared independence on July 26, 1847. Americo-Liberians dominated politics until 1980, when Samuel Doe seized power in a coup.

The country was devastated by civil wars (1989-2003) that killed over 250,000 people. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female head of state, led reconstruction efforts. Former soccer star George Weah served as president from 2018 to 2024.

## Geography

Liberia has a tropical climate with heavy rainfall. The landscape consists of coastal plains, rolling hills, and low mountains in the north. The country retains significant rainforest cover, particularly in the southeast. The coastline stretches 579 kilometers along the Atlantic.

## Economy

Liberia's economy is based on iron ore mining, rubber plantations, and timber. The country hosts the world's second-largest ship registry (flags of convenience). The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic severely impacted the economy and healthcare system. Foreign investment is recovering slowly.

## Culture

Liberian culture blends African and American influences. The Americo-Liberian heritage is visible in architecture and traditions in Monrovia. Indigenous groups include the Kpelle, Bassa, and Gio. Liberian English has distinctive features, and traditional music and masquerade societies remain important.
