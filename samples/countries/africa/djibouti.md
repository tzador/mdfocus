Ismaïl Omar Guelleh has been president since 1999, following his uncle Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who led the country from independence.

## Geography

Djibouti is one of the hottest and driest countries on Earth, with temperatures regularly exceeding 40°C. The terrain includes coastal plains, volcanic plateaus, and mountains. Lake Assal, at 155 meters below sea level, is the lowest point in Africa and one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world.

## Economy

Djibouti's economy is based on its strategic location and service sector, particularly its port facilities. The Port of Djibouti handles most of landlocked Ethiopia's trade. The country hosts military bases from France, the United States, China, Japan, and Italy, generating significant revenue. Limited natural resources restrict other economic development.

## Culture

Djiboutian culture blends Somali, Afar, and French influences. Traditional nomadic lifestyle remains important to many, though most now live in urban areas. Poetry and oral tradition are highly valued. The country has a unique cuisine combining African and Middle Eastern elements.
