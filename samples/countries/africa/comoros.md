## History

The Comoros islands were populated by a succession of peoples from the African coast, the Arabian Peninsula, and Southeast Asia. Arab traders introduced Islam in the 10th century. France colonized the islands in the 19th century.

The Comoros declared independence in 1975, but Mayotte voted to remain French. The country has experienced over 20 coups or attempted coups since independence, making it one of the world's most politically unstable nations.

## Geography

The Comoros consists of three main volcanic islands: Grande Comore (Ngazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), and Anjouan (Nzwani). Mount Karthala on Grande Comore is an active volcano and the highest point at 2,361 meters. The islands have tropical rainforests and are known for their biodiversity, including the rare coelacanth fish discovered in nearby waters.

## Economy

The Comoros is one of the world's poorest countries, dependent on agriculture, fishing, and remittances. The islands are among the world's largest producers of ylang-ylang, used in perfumes. Vanilla and cloves are other important exports. Tourism has potential but remains underdeveloped.

## Culture

Comorian culture blends African, Arab, and French influences. Islam is the dominant religion, and society follows traditional structures with emphasis on elaborate weddings called "Grand Mariage." The islands are known for their distinctive architecture, traditional medicine, and oral poetry.
