## History

The islands were uninhabited until their discovery by Portuguese explorers in 1456. Cabo Verde became an important hub for the transatlantic slave trade due to its strategic location. The islands remained a Portuguese colony until independence on July 5, 1975.

Since independence, Cabo Verde has developed into one of Africa's most stable democracies, with peaceful transitions of power and a multi-party system. It's often cited as a model of democratic governance in Africa.

## Geography

Cabo Verde consists of ten islands and several islets divided into two groups: the windward (Barlavento) islands to the north and leeward (Sotavento) islands to the south. The islands are volcanic, with Pico do Fogo (2,829 m) being the highest point. The climate is arid, and droughts are common.

## Economy

Cabo Verde has a service-oriented economy, with tourism being the main sector. The country imports most of its food and consumer goods. Remittances from the large diaspora (more Cape Verdeans live abroad than in the country) are crucial to the economy. Fishing and light manufacturing are also important sectors.

## Culture

Cape Verdean culture is a unique blend of African and Portuguese influences, known for its music, particularly morna (made famous by singer Cesária Évora) and coladeira. The concept of "morabeza" (hospitality and warmth) is central to Cape Verdean identity. Creole (Kriolu) is widely spoken alongside Portuguese.
