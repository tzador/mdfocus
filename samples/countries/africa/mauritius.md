## History

Mauritius was uninhabited until Arab sailors and later Portuguese explorers arrived. The Dutch colonized it in 1638, naming it after Prince Maurice of Nassau. French and then British rule followed. The country gained independence on March 12, 1968.

Mauritius has transformed from a low-income, agriculture-based economy to one of Africa's most stable and prosperous democracies, often called the "Mauritian Miracle."

## Geography

The main island is volcanic in origin, surrounded by coral reefs. The terrain includes a central plateau, mountains, and coastal plains. The country also includes Rodrigues Island and smaller outer islands. The famous "underwater waterfall" illusion attracts tourists.

## Economy

Mauritius has successfully diversified from sugar monoculture to textiles, tourism, financial services, and technology. It is one of Africa's most business-friendly countries and has the continent's highest income per capita. The country serves as a hub for investment into Africa and India.

## Culture

Mauritian culture is a blend of Indian, African, Chinese, and European influences. Multiple religions coexist harmoniously, including Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Sega music and dance, with African roots, is the national cultural symbol. The cuisine reflects the island's diverse heritage.
