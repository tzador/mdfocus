## History

Ancient Egypt was one of the world's earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, with a history spanning over 3,000 years of pharaonic rule. The country was subsequently ruled by Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottomans, and British before gaining full independence in 1952.

Modern Egypt was shaped by leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser, who championed Arab nationalism, and Anwar Sadat, who made peace with Israel. The 2011 revolution ousted Hosni Mubarak after 30 years of rule.

## Geography

Egypt is predominantly desert, with 95% of the population living in the Nile Valley and Delta. The Nile River, the world's longest, has been the lifeblood of Egyptian civilization for millennia. The Suez Canal, connecting the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, is one of the world's most important waterways.

## Economy

Egypt has the third-largest economy in Africa, diversified across tourism, agriculture, industry, and services. The Suez Canal generates substantial revenue, and remittances from Egyptians abroad are significant. Tourism, centered on ancient monuments and Red Sea resorts, is a major employer but vulnerable to regional instability.

## Culture

Egyptian culture spans thousands of years and has profoundly influenced world civilization. Modern Egypt is a center of Arab culture, producing renowned films, music, and literature. Cairo is home to Al-Azhar University, one of the world's oldest and most prestigious Islamic institutions.
