## History

The territory was colonized by Portugal in 1474 and ceded to Spain in 1778, becoming Spanish Guinea. Independence came on October 12, 1968. The first president, Francisco Macías Nguema, established a brutal dictatorship until he was overthrown in 1979 by his nephew, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

Obiang has ruled since 1979, making him Africa's longest-serving head of state. Large oil discoveries in the 1990s transformed the country's economy.

## Geography

Equatorial Guinea comprises a mainland region (Río Muni) and five islands, with Bioko Island hosting the capital, Malabo. The terrain includes dense tropical rainforests, mangroves, and volcanic landscapes. Pico Basile on Bioko is the highest point at 3,011 meters.

## Economy

Oil and gas dominate the economy, discovered in commercial quantities in 1996. This has made Equatorial Guinea one of sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil producers and wealthiest countries per capita. However, wealth is extremely concentrated, and most citizens remain poor. The government is building a new capital city, Ciudad de la Paz, on the mainland.

## Culture

Equatorial Guinean culture reflects Fang, Bubi, and Spanish influences. Traditional music and dance remain important, particularly for the Bubi people of Bioko. Spanish colonial architecture characterizes Malabo. The country observes both African traditions and Catholic practices.
