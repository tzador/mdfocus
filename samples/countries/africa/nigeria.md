## History

Nigeria has a rich pre-colonial history, including the Nok civilization, Benin Kingdom, and Hausa city-states. British colonization amalgamated diverse peoples into a single territory. Independence came on October 1, 1960.

The country has faced challenges including a civil war (Biafra, 1967-1970), military coups, and ethnic tensions. Democracy was restored in 1999, though governance challenges persist.

## Geography

Nigeria has diverse landscapes: mangrove swamps and rainforests in the south, savanna in the center, and semi-arid conditions in the north. The Niger and Benue rivers are major waterways. The Jos Plateau provides cooler temperatures. The Niger Delta is the center of oil production.

## Economy

Nigeria has Africa's largest economy, dominated by oil and gas. It is the continent's largest oil producer and was once in OPEC (rejoined 2024). However, wealth is unevenly distributed, and most Nigerians remain poor. The country has a vibrant entrepreneurial sector and growing tech industry (particularly in Lagos).

## Culture

Nigeria has over 250 ethnic groups and 500 languages. It is a cultural powerhouse: Nollywood produces more films than Hollywood, Afrobeats music has global reach, and Nigerian literature (Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie) is internationally acclaimed. Football is a national passion.
