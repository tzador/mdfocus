## History

The Rwandan kingdom predated European colonization. Germany and then Belgium ruled the territory, exacerbating ethnic divisions between Hutu and Tutsi. Independence came in 1962 amid violence.

The 1994 genocide against the Tutsi killed approximately 800,000 people in 100 days. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, led by Paul Kagame, ended the genocide and has governed since. Under Kagame, Rwanda has become known for development and order, though critics cite authoritarian governance.

## Geography

Rwanda is one of Africa's most densely populated countries, with a mountainous landscape. Virunga Mountains in the northwest are home to endangered mountain gorillas. Lake Kivu forms the western border. The country has a temperate climate despite its equatorial location due to high elevation.

## Economy

Rwanda has achieved significant economic growth, transitioning toward services, technology, and tourism. Kigali is one of Africa's cleanest cities and a growing conference destination. Gorilla tourism is highly profitable. Coffee and tea are key agricultural exports. The country aims to become a middle-income nation.

## Culture

Rwandan culture emphasizes unity post-genocide; ethnic identification is discouraged. Traditional dance, especially Intore warrior dance, is celebrated. The country is known for imigongo cow dung art and basket weaving. Communal work (umuganda) and community justice (gacaca courts) are important social practices.
