## History

The territory was home to various Akan kingdoms, including the powerful Ashanti Empire. European contact began in the 15th century, with the coast becoming a major center of the Atlantic slave trade. Britain colonized the region as the Gold Coast.

Ghana gained independence on March 6, 1957, under Kwame Nkrumah, a pan-African visionary. The country has since become one of Africa's most stable democracies, with multiple peaceful transfers of power.

## Geography

Ghana lies along the Gulf of Guinea, with a landscape ranging from coastal savannas to tropical rainforests in the south and drier savanna in the north. Lake Volta, created by the Akosombo Dam, is one of the world's largest artificial lakes by surface area.

## Economy

Ghana has one of West Africa's strongest economies, based on gold (the country was historically called the Gold Coast), cocoa, and increasingly oil and gas. It is the world's second-largest cocoa producer. The country has a growing middle class and has made significant progress in poverty reduction.

## Culture

Ghanaian culture is known for colorful Kente cloth, traditional festivals like Homowo and Panafest, and highlife music. The Ashanti people's gold weights and stools are culturally significant. Ghanaian cuisine features dishes like jollof rice, fufu, and banku.
