## History

The territory of present-day Angola was inhabited by various Bantu peoples before Portuguese colonization began in the 15th century. Angola was a major source of enslaved people sent to the Americas, particularly Brazil. After centuries of colonial rule, Angola gained independence from Portugal on November 11, 1975.

Independence was followed by a devastating civil war that lasted from 1975 to 2002, involving various factions supported by Cold War powers. The war ended with the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, leading to a peace agreement.

## Geography

Angola features diverse landscapes, from tropical rainforests in the north to arid deserts in the south. The country has a 1,600-kilometer Atlantic coastline and is home to the Congo Basin rainforest and the Namib Desert. The Kwanza River is the largest river flowing entirely within Angola.

## Economy

Angola is one of Africa's major oil producers and one of the world's largest diamond producers. Oil accounts for over 90% of exports and nearly 70% of government revenue. The country is working to diversify its economy through agriculture, fisheries, and manufacturing to reduce dependence on oil.

## Culture

Angolan culture reflects its Bantu heritage and Portuguese colonial history. The country is known for semba and kizomba music, which have gained international popularity. Traditional arts include wood carving, pottery, and textile weaving. Angolan literature, written primarily in Portuguese, has produced renowned authors like Pepetela and José Eduardo Agualusa.
