## History

Madagascar was first settled by Austronesian peoples from Borneo around 350-550 CE, later joined by Bantu migrants from Africa. The Merina Kingdom dominated the island before French colonization in 1896. Independence came on June 26, 1960.

The country has experienced political instability, including a 2009 crisis when President Marc Ravalomanana was forced from power. Andry Rajoelina has dominated recent politics.

## Geography

Madagascar split from Africa about 160 million years ago and from India about 88 million years ago, allowing unique species to evolve in isolation. The terrain includes coastal lowlands, central highlands, and tropical rainforests. About 90% of wildlife species are endemic, including lemurs, fossas, and baobab trees.

## Economy

Madagascar is one of the world's poorest countries despite natural resources. Agriculture dominates, with vanilla (the country produces most of the world's supply), coffee, and cloves as key exports. Mining (nickel, cobalt, sapphires) is growing. Ecotourism has potential but faces infrastructure challenges.

## Culture

Malagasy culture reflects its Austronesian and African heritage. The concept of "fihavanana" (solidarity) and "famadihana" (turning of the bones) ancestor veneration are important traditions. Rice is the staple food, and zebu cattle have cultural and economic significance. Traditional music features the valiha (bamboo zither).
