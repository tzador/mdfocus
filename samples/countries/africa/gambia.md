## History

The Gambia was part of various West African empires before becoming a British colony in 1821. Its unusual shape resulted from competing colonial claims between Britain and France. The country gained independence on February 18, 1965.

Yahya Jammeh seized power in 1994 and ruled autocratically until 2016, when he lost an election to Adama Barrow but initially refused to concede. A regional intervention restored democracy.

## Geography

The Gambia is essentially the Gambia River and its banks, extending about 450 kilometers inland from the Atlantic. The country is never more than 50 kilometers wide. The river, navigable deep into the interior, was crucial for historical trade. Ecosystems range from mangroves to savanna.

## Economy

The Gambia has limited natural resources, with agriculture, tourism, and remittances forming the economic base. Groundnuts (peanuts) have traditionally been the main export crop. Beaches attract European tourists, and the country has become popular for "roots tourism" related to the book and TV series "Roots."

## Culture

Gambian culture reflects its ethnic diversity, including Mandinka, Fula, Wolof, and Jola peoples. Kora music, featuring the 21-string harp-lute, is particularly significant. The country hosts the Roots Homecoming Festival and is known for its friendly people and relaxed atmosphere.
