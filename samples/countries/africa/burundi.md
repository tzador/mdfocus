## History

Burundi was a kingdom for over 200 years before German colonization in the late 19th century. After World War I, it became part of Belgian-administered Ruanda-Urundi. The country gained independence in 1962, retaining its monarchy until 1966.

Burundi has experienced significant ethnic tensions between Hutu and Tutsi populations, including a civil war (1993-2005) that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Recent years have seen political crises and ongoing instability.

## Geography

Burundi is a mountainous country, often called the "Heart of Africa" due to its central location. The western border is formed by Lake Tanganyika, the second-deepest lake in the world. The country's highest point is Mount Heha at 2,670 meters. Despite its small size, Burundi has diverse ecosystems.

## Economy

Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries, with most of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea are the main export crops. The country faces challenges including high population density, limited natural resources, and the legacy of civil conflict.

## Culture

Burundian culture is centered on traditions of the Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa peoples who share a common language, Kirundi. The country is famous for its drumming traditions, particularly the Royal Drummers of Burundi. Traditional dance and storytelling play important roles in cultural life.
