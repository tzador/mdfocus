## History

The region was inhabited by various Bantu peoples before British colonization as Northern Rhodesia. Copper mining developed from the 1920s. Independence came on October 24, 1964, under Kenneth Kaunda, who promoted "African humanism."

Zambia has experienced peaceful transfers of power, including the 2021 election of Hakainde Hichilema, demonstrating democratic resilience rare in the region.

## Geography

Zambia is a high plateau country with forests, grasslands, and the Zambezi and Kafue river systems. Victoria Falls (Mosi-oa-Tunya, "The Smoke that Thunders") on the Zimbabwe border is one of the world's largest waterfalls. Lake Tanganyika, Kariba, and Bangweulu are significant water bodies.

## Economy

Copper mining dominates Zambia's economy, with the country being Africa's second-largest producer. Agriculture, including maize and tobacco, employs most of the population. Tourism focused on wildlife and Victoria Falls is growing. Diversification away from copper dependence is a priority.

## Culture

Zambia has over 70 ethnic groups and languages, with remarkable social cohesion. Traditional ceremonies, such as the Kuomboka of the Lozi people, are elaborate cultural events. Zambian music blends traditional rhythms with modern styles. Football is the most popular sport.
