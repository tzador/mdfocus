## History

Niger was part of several West African empires and kingdoms, including Songhai. French colonization began in the late 19th century. Independence came on August 3, 1960. The country has experienced multiple coups, most recently in 2023, resulting in sanctions and tensions with France and regional neighbors.

## Geography

Niger is one of the world's hottest countries, with over 80% of its territory in the Sahara Desert. The Sahel region in the south supports most agriculture and population. The Niger River flows through the southwest. The Aïr Mountains and Ténéré Desert in the north are UNESCO-listed.

## Economy

Niger is consistently ranked among the world's least developed countries. Uranium mining has been a key resource, though prices have been volatile. Agriculture and herding are the main livelihoods, heavily impacted by droughts and desertification. Population growth (the world's highest fertility rate) strains limited resources.

## Culture

Niger has diverse ethnic groups, including Hausa, Zarma-Songhai, Tuareg, and Fulani. The Festival au Désert and Cure Salée (salt cure) celebrate nomadic traditions. Traditional music, especially Tuareg guitar, has gained international recognition. Islam is the dominant religion.
