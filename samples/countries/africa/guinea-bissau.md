## History

The region was part of the Kaabu kingdom, a tributary of the Mali Empire. Portuguese traders arrived in the 15th century, and the territory became Portuguese Guinea. After an 11-year liberation war led by Amílcar Cabral, Guinea-Bissau gained independence in 1974.

Since independence, the country has experienced chronic political instability, including a civil war (1998-1999) and multiple coups. It has struggled with drug trafficking and weak institutions.

## Geography

Guinea-Bissau has a coastal plain with mangrove swamps and rainforest, rising to savanna in the east. The Bijagós Archipelago, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, comprises 88 islands off the coast. The country has a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons.

## Economy

Guinea-Bissau is one of the world's poorest countries, heavily dependent on cashew nut exports, which account for over 90% of export earnings. Fishing is important but largely exploited by foreign fleets. The country has become a transit point for South American cocaine bound for Europe, complicating governance.

## Culture

Guinea-Bissau has a diverse culture, with the Balanta, Fula, and Mandinka among the largest ethnic groups. Gumbe music, blending Portuguese and African influences, is distinctive. The Bijagós people maintain unique traditions on their islands. Carnival in Bissau is a significant celebration.
