## History

Kenya has a rich archaeological heritage, with fossils suggesting it may be the cradle of humankind. The Swahili coast was part of Indian Ocean trade networks for centuries. Britain colonized the interior in the late 19th century, establishing the Kenya Colony.

The Mau Mau Uprising (1952-1960) was a significant anti-colonial movement. Kenya gained independence on December 12, 1963, under Jomo Kenyatta. His son, Uhuru Kenyatta, served as president from 2013 to 2022.

The Maasai Mara is famous for the annual wildebeest migration. Lakes Victoria, Turkana, and Nakuru are significant water bodies.

## Economy
