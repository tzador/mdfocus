## History

Algeria has a rich history dating back to ancient times, with evidence of human habitation from as early as 1.8 million years ago. The region was home to various Berber kingdoms before becoming part of the Roman Empire. After the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam and Arabic culture became predominant.

The country was colonized by France in 1830 and remained under French rule until it gained independence in 1962 following a brutal eight-year war of independence. The Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962) was one of the most significant decolonization conflicts of the 20th century.

## Geography

Algeria is the largest country in Africa, with the Sahara Desert covering more than 80% of its territory. The northern region features the Tell Atlas mountain range and a narrow coastal plain with a Mediterranean climate. The Hoggar Mountains in the south contain the highest peak, Mount Tahat, at 2,908 meters.

## Economy

Algeria's economy is heavily dependent on hydrocarbon exports, particularly oil and natural gas, which account for approximately 95% of export earnings. The country has the 10th-largest natural gas reserves in the world and is Africa's largest natural gas exporter. Efforts to diversify the economy are ongoing, with investments in agriculture, tourism, and renewable energy.

## Culture

Algerian culture is a blend of Arab, Berber, and French influences. The country is known for its distinctive music, including Raï, which originated in Oran, and Chaabi. Algerian cuisine features dishes like couscous, merguez, and tajine. The country has produced notable literary figures, including Nobel Prize winner Albert Camus.
