## History

Ethiopia is unique in Africa for never being colonized (aside from a brief Italian occupation from 1936-1941). The Ethiopian Empire, ruled by the Solomonic dynasty claiming descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, lasted until 1974.

Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown by a Marxist military junta (the Derg), which itself fell in 1991. The country has since been a federal republic, though recent conflicts, particularly in Tigray (2020-2022), have caused significant turmoil.

## Geography

Ethiopia is predominantly a highland country, with the Ethiopian Highlands covering much of the territory. The Great Rift Valley runs through the country, containing lakes and diverse ecosystems. The Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana and provides most of the Nile's water. Ras Dashen is the highest peak at 4,550 meters.

## Economy

Ethiopia has been one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, with ambitious industrialization plans. Agriculture, particularly coffee (which originated here), remains crucial. The country has invested heavily in infrastructure, including the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Despite progress, poverty remains widespread.

## Culture

Ethiopia has a unique cultural heritage, including its own alphabet (Ge'ez script), calendar, and cuisine. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church is one of the world's oldest Christian denominations. Ethiopian cuisine, featuring injera (flatbread) and various stews, is distinctive. The country's diverse ethnic groups include the Oromo, Amhara, and Tigray.
