## History

Libya was part of ancient Phoenician, Greek, Roman, and Arab civilizations. Ottoman rule lasted from the 16th century until Italian colonization in 1911. Independence came in 1951 under King Idris.

Muammar Gaddafi seized power in 1969 and ruled for 42 years until the 2011 civil war and NATO intervention led to his overthrow and death. The country has since been divided between rival governments and militias.

## Geography

Libya is the fourth-largest country in Africa, with about 90% of its territory covered by the Sahara Desert. The population is concentrated along the Mediterranean coast. Key geographical features include the Tibesti Mountains in the south and various oases. The country has no permanent rivers.

## Economy

Libya's economy is almost entirely dependent on oil and gas exports. Before 2011, it had Africa's highest Human Development Index. Civil conflict has severely disrupted production, though it remains a major exporter. The country has minimal agriculture due to its desert climate.

## Culture

Libyan culture is predominantly Arab and Berber, with strong Islamic influence. Traditional music, poetry, and tribal customs remain important. The ancient cities of Leptis Magna and Sabratha are UNESCO World Heritage Sites showcasing Roman architecture. Libyan cuisine features dishes like bazin and couscous.
