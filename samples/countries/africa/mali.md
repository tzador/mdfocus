## History

Mali was the heartland of several great West African empires: Ghana (4th-13th centuries), Mali (13th-16th centuries), and Songhai (15th-16th centuries). Timbuktu became a legendary center of learning and trade. France colonized the territory in the late 19th century.

Mali gained independence in 1960. After decades of one-party rule, democracy emerged in 1991. A 2012 Tuareg rebellion and Islamist insurgency led to a French military intervention. Military coups in 2020 and 2021 have resulted in ongoing political transition.

## Geography

Mali is Africa's eighth-largest country, mostly covered by the Sahara Desert and Sahel savanna. The Niger River, the country's lifeblood, creates a fertile inland delta crucial for fishing and agriculture. Only the southern region receives adequate rainfall for farming.

## Economy

Mali is one of the world's poorest countries, with most people depending on subsistence agriculture. The country is a significant gold producer and cotton exporter. Economic development is hampered by conflict, limited infrastructure, and landlocked geography.

## Culture

Mali has an extraordinarily rich cultural heritage, particularly in music. Legendary musicians like Ali Farka Touré and Salif Keita have gained international fame. The city of Djenné features remarkable mud-brick architecture, including the world's largest mud mosque. Malian literature and the griots (oral historians) preserve centuries of history.
