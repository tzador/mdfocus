## History

The Basotho nation was founded by King Moshoeshoe I in the early 19th century, who united various clans seeking refuge from the Mfecane wars. The kingdom became a British protectorate (Basutoland) in 1868 to avoid Boer annexation. Lesotho gained independence on October 4, 1966.

The country has experienced political instability, including coups and regional military interventions. The current king, Letsie III, serves a ceremonial role.

## Geography

Lesotho is entirely highlands, with the lowest point at 1,400 meters. The Maluti Mountains dominate the landscape, with Thabana Ntlenyana (3,482 m) being the highest peak in Southern Africa. The country is the source of major rivers and has significant water resources, exported to South Africa via the Lesotho Highlands Water Project.

## Economy

Lesotho has a developing economy heavily dependent on South Africa. Textile manufacturing for export is a major industry, benefiting from trade preferences. Remittances from Basotho working in South African mines are crucial. Water exports and diamond mining contribute to government revenue.

## Culture

Basotho culture is centered on traditions of cattle herding and blanket wearing. The iconic Basotho blanket is worn as traditional dress. Traditional music includes famo, featuring the lekolulo (flute) and accordion. The Basotho pony is specially adapted to the mountainous terrain.
