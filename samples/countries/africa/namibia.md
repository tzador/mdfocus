## History

The San people have inhabited the region for thousands of years. Germany colonized the territory as German South West Africa in 1884, committing genocide against the Herero and Nama peoples (1904-1908). South Africa controlled the territory after World War I.

After a long liberation struggle, Namibia gained independence on March 21, 1990, the last African country to do so. SWAPO, the liberation movement, has governed since independence.

## Geography

Namibia is dominated by the Namib Desert (possibly the world's oldest desert) along the coast and the Kalahari in the east. The Skeleton Coast is known for shipwrecks and seal colonies. Etosha National Park is one of Africa's greatest wildlife reserves. The Fish River Canyon is the world's second-largest canyon.

## Economy

Namibia is upper-middle income by African standards, with a mixed economy. Mining (diamonds, uranium) is the major industry. Tourism is crucial, drawing visitors to landscapes and wildlife. Fishing off the Benguela Current is productive. The country has significant renewable energy potential.

## Culture

Namibia has diverse ethnic groups, including the Ovambo, Herero, and San. The Herero women's Victorian-style dresses are distinctive. German colonial influence remains visible in architecture and a German-speaking minority. Traditional arts include basketry and beadwork.
