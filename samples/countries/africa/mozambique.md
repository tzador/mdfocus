**Mozambique**, officially the **Republic of Mozambique**, is a country in southeastern Africa. With a long Indian Ocean coastline, it was a Portuguese colony for nearly five centuries and is now one of the world's fastest-growing economies due to natural gas discoveries.

## History

Bantu peoples migrated to the area around the 1st century CE. Arab traders established coastal settlements, and the Portuguese arrived in 1498, controlling the territory for over 450 years. A decade-long independence war led to freedom on June 25, 1975.

A devastating civil war (1977-1992) killed nearly one million people. Since peace, Mozambique has experienced economic growth, though an Islamist insurgency in the north since 2017 poses new challenges.

## Geography

Mozambique has a 2,500-kilometer coastline with excellent natural harbors. The Zambezi River, Africa's fourth-longest, flows through the country, and the Cahora Bassa Dam is a major hydroelectric facility. The terrain includes coastal lowlands, central highlands, and plateaus in the west.

## Economy

Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries but has significant growth potential. Massive natural gas reserves discovered offshore could transform the economy. Agriculture employs most of the population, while aluminum smelting and coal mining are important. Ports serve landlocked neighbors.

## Culture

Mozambican culture reflects Bantu, Portuguese, and coastal influences. The Makonde people are known for intricate wood sculpture. Marrabenta is the national music style. Portuguese remains the official language, though numerous Bantu languages are widely spoken.
