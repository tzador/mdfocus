## History

The region was inhabited by various Bantu peoples when Portuguese explorers arrived in the 15th century. France colonized the territory in 1885, and Gabon became independent on August 17, 1960.

The Bongo family dominated politics for decades: Omar Bongo ruled from 1967 to 2009, succeeded by his son Ali Bongo until a 2023 military coup ended their dynasty. The coup followed disputed elections.

## Geography

About 85% of Gabon is covered by tropical rainforest, making it one of Africa's most forested countries. The country lies on the equator, with a hot and humid climate year-round. Gabon has significant biodiversity, including forest elephants, gorillas, and chimpanzees. The Ogooué River is the principal waterway.

## Economy

Gabon is one of Africa's wealthiest countries per capita, thanks to oil production and small population. Oil, manganese, and timber are the main exports. The country is working to diversify into ecotourism and has set aside 11% of its territory as national parks. However, wealth is unequally distributed.

## Culture

Gabonese culture reflects the traditions of over 40 ethnic groups, with the Fang being the largest. Traditional mask-making, particularly Fang reliquary figures, is renowned worldwide. The Bwiti spiritual tradition, using the psychoactive iboga plant, is an important cultural practice.
