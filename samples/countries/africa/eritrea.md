## History

Eritrea was an Italian colony from 1890 to 1941, then under British administration until federation with Ethiopia in 1952. Full Ethiopian annexation in 1962 sparked a prolonged independence struggle led by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.

Independence in 1993 was followed by a border war with Ethiopia (1998-2000) and ongoing tensions until a 2018 peace agreement. President Isaias Afwerki has led the country since independence, maintaining authoritarian control.

## Geography

Eritrea has a diverse landscape: a narrow coastal plain along the Red Sea, central highlands rising to 3,000 meters, and western lowlands. The Danakil Depression in the southeast is one of the hottest and lowest places on Earth. The country includes the Dahlak Archipelago in the Red Sea.

## Economy

Eritrea has a developing economy based on agriculture, mining, and services. Most of the population engages in subsistence farming and herding. Gold and other mineral resources offer potential, but economic development is hindered by prolonged military mobilization, sanctions, and isolation.

## Culture

Eritrean culture reflects its nine ethnic groups, each with distinct languages and traditions. The capital Asmara is known for its Italian colonial and Art Deco architecture, earning UNESCO World Heritage status. Coffee ceremonies, traditional music, and dance are important cultural practices.
