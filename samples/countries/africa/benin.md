## History

Benin was the seat of the powerful Kingdom of Dahomey, one of the most powerful states in West Africa from the 17th to 19th centuries. The kingdom was known for its all-female military regiment, the Dahomey Amazons. France colonized the region in 1894, and it became the French colony of Dahomey.

The country gained independence in 1960 and was renamed Benin in 1975. It became one of Africa's most stable democracies after transitioning from Marxism-Leninism in 1990.

## Geography

Benin stretches north-south between the Niger River and the Atlantic Ocean. The southern region features coastal lowlands and lagoons, while the north has savanna and semi-arid plains. The Pendjari National Park in the northwest is one of West Africa's most important wildlife reserves.

## Economy

Benin's economy is primarily based on agriculture, with cotton being the main export crop. The country also benefits significantly from transit trade with Nigeria and serves as a commercial hub for the region. The Port of Cotonou is vital for landlocked neighbors like Niger and Burkina Faso.

## Culture

Benin is considered the birthplace of Vodun (Voodoo), which remains an official religion. The country is known for its bronze sculptures, traditional festivals, and vibrant markets. Beninese cuisine features dishes like akassa, a fermented corn dough, and grilled fish.
