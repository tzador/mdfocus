## History

The region was part of several African kingdoms before French colonization in the 19th century. Côte d'Ivoire gained independence on August 7, 1960. Under Félix Houphouët-Boigny, the country experienced rapid economic growth and was considered a model of stability.

Political instability emerged after Houphouët-Boigny's death in 1993, culminating in civil wars (2002-2007 and 2010-2011). The country has since stabilized and returned to strong economic growth.

## Geography

Côte d'Ivoire has a diverse landscape: a forested interior, savanna in the north, and 515 kilometers of Atlantic coastline. The country was once heavily forested, but deforestation has significantly reduced forest cover. Mount Nimba on the Guinea border is the highest point at 1,752 meters.

## Economy

Côte d'Ivoire has the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union. It produces about 40% of the world's cocoa, along with coffee, palm oil, and rubber. The country also has oil reserves and is developing its manufacturing sector. Abidjan is a major regional business hub.

## Culture

With over 60 ethnic groups, Ivorian culture is diverse. The country is known for its traditional masks, particularly those of the Dan and Baoulé peoples. Ivorian music includes zouglou, coupé-décalé, and reggae. Football is the national passion, with the national team nicknamed "The Elephants."
