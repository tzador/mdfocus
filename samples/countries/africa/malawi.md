## History

The area was settled by Bantu peoples around the 10th century. The Maravi Confederacy was a powerful kingdom from the 15th to 18th centuries. Britain established the Nyasaland Protectorate in 1891. Malawi gained independence on July 6, 1964.

Hastings Kamuzu Banda ruled autocratically until 1994, when multi-party democracy was introduced. The 2020 election, in which courts annulled fraudulent results and opposition leader Lazarus Chakwera subsequently won, was praised as a democratic breakthrough.

## Geography

Lake Malawi, the country's defining feature, covers about 20% of the territory and is Africa's third-largest lake. The Great Rift Valley runs through the country. Landscapes range from the Nyika Plateau in the north to the Shire Highlands in the south. Mount Mulanje (3,002 m) is the highest peak.

## Economy

Malawi is one of the world's least developed countries, with most people engaged in subsistence farming. Tobacco is the main export crop, though diversification efforts include tea, sugar, and cotton. The country is highly vulnerable to climate shocks, and food security is a persistent concern.

## Culture

Malawian culture centers on community and tradition. The Chewa, Yao, and Tumbuka are major ethnic groups, each with distinct customs and dances. Gule Wamkulu, a masked dance of the Chewa, is a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Music and dance play important roles in ceremonies and daily life.
