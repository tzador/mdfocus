## History

British abolitionists founded Freetown in 1787 as a settlement for freed slaves. The territory became a British colony and protectorate. Independence came on April 27, 1961.

A brutal civil war (1991-2002) devastated the country, fueled by conflict diamonds and characterized by atrocities. The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic further set back development.

## Geography

Sierra Leone has a tropical climate with heavily wooded hills and mountains in the east and mangrove swamps and beaches along the coast. The Western Area Peninsula includes rainforest reserves. The country has significant mineral deposits.

## Economy

Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries despite diamond and mineral wealth. The economy relies on mining (diamonds, iron ore, rutile), agriculture, and fishing. Recovery from war and Ebola continues. Freetown's natural harbor is one of Africa's finest.

## Culture

Sierra Leone has diverse ethnic groups, with the Temne and Mende being largest. Krio culture, descended from freed slaves, centers on Freetown. Traditional secret societies play important social roles. Music and dance are vibrant, and Freetown has an active arts scene.
