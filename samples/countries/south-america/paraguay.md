## Geography

Paraguay is divided by the Paraguay River into the eastern region (where most people live) and the Gran Chaco in the west. The climate is subtropical. The country has no coastline but extensive river access.

Agriculture (soybeans, beef) and hydroelectric power (Itaipu Dam, shared with Brazil) drive the economy. Paraguay is known for contraband trade and has a large informal sector.
