## History

Indigenous peoples inhabited Argentina before Spanish colonization. Independence came in 1816. Large-scale European immigration (especially Italian) in the late 19th century shaped modern Argentina. Peronism remains a major political force. The "Dirty War" (1976-1983) saw military dictatorship and disappearances.

## Geography

Argentina stretches from the subtropics to the subantarctic. Landscapes include the Pampas grasslands, Andes mountains, Patagonian steppe, and Iguazu Falls. The country claims part of Antarctica.

## Economy

Argentina has abundant agricultural resources (beef, soybeans, wine) but has experienced repeated crises and defaults. Inflation is chronically high. President Milei's 2023 election brought radical libertarian economic policies.

## Culture

Argentine culture is distinctive: tango, football (Maradona, Messi), asado (barbecue), and mate drinking. Buenos Aires is a cultural capital with European influence. Literature (Borges) and psychoanalysis are important.
