## History

Aboriginal Australians inhabited the continent for over 65,000 years—the world's oldest continuous culture. British colonization began in 1788 with a penal colony at Sydney. The Commonwealth of Australia federated in 1901. Immigration, especially post-WWII, created a multicultural society.

## Geography

Australia is the world's smallest continent and largest island. The outback dominates the interior, while most people live in coastal cities. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system. Unique wildlife includes kangaroos, koalas, and platypuses.

## Economy

Australia has a highly developed economy based on mining (iron ore, coal, gold), agriculture, services, and education exports. Trade with Asia, especially China, is crucial.

## Culture

Australian culture blends British heritage with multicultural influences and Aboriginal traditions. The outdoors, sport (cricket, Australian rules football), and beach culture are central. "Fair go" and laid-back attitudes are stereotypes with truth.
