## History

The Khmer Empire (802-1431) built Angkor Wat and dominated Southeast Asia. French colonial rule lasted from 1863 to 1953. After independence, Cambodia was drawn into the Vietnam War.

The Khmer Rouge (1975-1979) under Pol Pot killed nearly 2 million people—a quarter of the population—in genocide. Vietnam's invasion ended the regime. Hun Sen has dominated politics since 1985.

## Geography

Cambodia is mostly lowland, centered on the Mekong River and Tonlé Sap (Great Lake), the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. The lake's size varies dramatically between seasons. The Cardamom Mountains lie in the southwest.

## Economy

Cambodia is a developing economy based on garments, tourism, and agriculture. Angkor Wat is a major tourist destination. The country has attracted manufacturing investment due to low labor costs. Corruption and weak institutions remain challenges.

## Culture

Khmer culture centers on Theravada Buddhism and the legacy of Angkor. Classical Apsara dance is a UNESCO tradition. Rice is the staple food. Despite the trauma of the Khmer Rouge, traditional arts and customs have been revived.
