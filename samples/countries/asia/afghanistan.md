## History

Afghanistan's strategic location made it part of ancient empires including Persian, Greek (Alexander the Great), and Mongol. Modern Afghanistan emerged in the 18th century. The country resisted British and Soviet invasions.

The Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) was followed by civil war and Taliban rule (1996-2001). U.S. intervention after 9/11 led to 20 years of conflict before the Taliban returned to power in 2021.

## Geography

Afghanistan is mountainous, dominated by the Hindu Kush range. The terrain varies from rugged mountains to desert plains. The country is landlocked, bordering Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China.

## Economy

Afghanistan is extremely poor, with decades of conflict devastating infrastructure and economy. Agriculture (wheat, opium poppies) and mining potential exist. International sanctions and frozen assets since 2021 have caused economic crisis.

## Culture

Afghan culture blends Persian, Turkic, and South Asian influences. Poetry, especially by Rumi (born in present-day Afghanistan), is revered. Traditional music, carpet weaving, and hospitality are important. Islam permeates daily life.
