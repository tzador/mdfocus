## History

Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire, then British Mandate. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War led to the Nakba (catastrophe), with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced. Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967.

The Palestinian Authority was established after the Oslo Accords (1993). Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2007. Conflict, negotiations, and occupation continue.

## Geography

The West Bank is hilly terrain west of the Jordan River. Gaza is a small, densely populated coastal strip. Israeli settlements and barriers fragment Palestinian territory. Access to water and resources is limited.

## Economy

The Palestinian economy is severely constrained by occupation, movement restrictions, and blockade (Gaza). Unemployment is high, particularly in Gaza. Agriculture, services, and international aid are economic mainstays.

## Culture

Palestinian culture is Arab and Islamic, with Christian minorities. Embroidery (tatreez), olive cultivation, and hospitality are traditions. Literature and art often address displacement and resistance. The Palestinian diaspora maintains cultural connections globally.
