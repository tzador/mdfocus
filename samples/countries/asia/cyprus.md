## History

Cyprus has ancient history, colonized by Greeks, ruled by various empires including Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman. Britain acquired the island in 1878. Independence came in 1960.

Intercommunal violence and a 1974 Greek-backed coup triggered Turkish military intervention, resulting in division. The Turkish-controlled north declared independence in 1983 but is only recognized by Turkey. Reunification talks continue.

Cyprus is the third-largest Mediterranean island. The terrain includes the Troodos Mountains, coastal plains, and the Mesaoria central plain. The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers. The UN-controlled Green Line divides the island.

## Economy

The Republic of Cyprus has a service-based economy, with tourism, shipping, and financial services as key sectors. EU membership brought growth and standards. The 2012-2013 banking crisis required an international bailout. The north has a separate, less developed economy.

## Culture

Greek Cypriot culture reflects Orthodox Christianity and Greek heritage. Traditional music, dance (syrtos), and cuisine are distinctive. Cyprus is known for halloumi cheese and Commandaria wine. The division has created separate cultural experiences in north and south.
