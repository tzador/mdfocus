Saparmurat Niyazov ("Turkmenbashi") ruled until 2006, creating an extreme personality cult. His successor, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, continued autocratic rule until passing power to his son in 2022.

## Geography

About 80% of Turkmenistan is covered by the Karakum Desert. The country borders the Caspian Sea but is otherwise landlocked. The climate is hot and arid. The Darvaza gas crater ("Door to Hell") is a notable feature.

## Economy

Natural gas is the economic foundation, with some of the world's largest reserves. However, exports are constrained by pipeline politics. The economy is state-controlled. Subsidies provide free utilities to citizens.

## Culture

Turkmen culture values horses (Akhal-Teke breed), carpets, and tribal traditions. The state promotes these traditions alongside the leader personality cult. Islam is the dominant religion. The capital Ashgabat is famous for its white marble buildings.
