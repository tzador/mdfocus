Kuwait was a trading port before oil discovery. It became a British protectorate in 1899 and independent in 1961. The Al Sabah dynasty has ruled for centuries.

Iraq's invasion in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War (1991) liberated Kuwait but caused massive destruction. The country has rebuilt and diversified since.
