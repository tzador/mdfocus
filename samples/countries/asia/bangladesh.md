## History

The Bengal region has ancient history, with powerful sultanates and Mughal rule. British India was partitioned in 1947, with East Bengal becoming part of Pakistan. After the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Bangladesh gained independence.

The country has experienced political instability, military coups, and natural disasters. Recent decades have seen remarkable economic growth, particularly in the garment industry.

## Geography

Bangladesh is mostly low-lying delta, formed by the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. This makes it extremely vulnerable to flooding and cyclones. The Sundarbans mangrove forest, home to Bengal tigers, is shared with India. Chittagong Hill Tracts provide the only highlands.

## Economy

Bangladesh has been one of the world's fastest-growing economies. The ready-made garment industry employs millions and is the world's second-largest exporter. Remittances from workers abroad are significant. Microfinance, pioneered by Grameen Bank, has reduced poverty.

## Culture

Bengali culture is rich in literature, music, and arts. Rabindranath Tagore, the first non-European Nobel laureate in Literature, is a cultural icon. The Bengali language was a driving force for independence. Cricket is the most popular sport. Rice and fish are dietary staples.
