## History

The Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan (13th century) was the largest contiguous land empire in history. After the empire's decline, Mongolia fell under Qing China's rule. Independence came in 1911, followed by Soviet-aligned communist rule until 1990.

Mongolia transitioned to democracy in 1990, one of the few successful post-communist transitions in Asia.

## Geography

Mongolia is vast, sparsely populated steppe, desert (Gobi), and mountains. The climate is extreme, with harsh winters and hot summers. Ulaanbaatar is the world's coldest capital. Nearly half the population lives in the capital.

## Economy

Mongolia has a developing economy based on mining (copper, gold, coal), livestock herding, and agriculture. The mining boom has brought wealth but also environmental concerns. Economic dependence on China and commodity prices creates volatility.

## Culture

Mongolian culture celebrates nomadic heritage. Traditional ger (yurt) living continues. Throat singing, horse culture, and Naadam festival (wrestling, archery, horse racing) are distinctive. Buddhism is the main religion, though shamanism persists.
